We are pleased to announce the creation of our new team, Club Futsal Altafulla, a project born from the love of futsal and the passion for sports in our beloved town of Altafulla. This team is the result of the joint effort of fans, players, and coaches who want to make history in local sports.

Club Futsal Altafulla is a team made up of players with a great passion for futsal, united by a common goal: to enjoy the sport and compete at the highest level. Despite being a newly created team, our aspirations are clear: we want to establish ourselves as a reference in the local league and gradually rise to more important competitions.

Our team consists of young local talents who have excelled in their respective youth clubs and more experienced players who bring knowledge and leadership both on and off the court.

At Club Futsal Altafulla, we are driven by more than just winning games. We firmly believe in the importance of values both on and off the court:

Effort and consistency: Every training session is an opportunity to improve. We are dedicated to honing our skills and giving our best in every game.
Teamwork: Futsal is a team sport, and in our team, unity and collaboration between teammates are fundamental.
Respect: We value fair play and treat both our teammates and our opponents with respect.
Fun: We never forget that the driving force behind this project is our love for futsal. We want to enjoy every moment!
With the team newly formed, we are ready to begin our adventure in the local league. Although we know the road will be challenging, we are convinced that with the effort of our players and the support of our fans, we will achieve great things.

Our coaches are already preparing intense training sessions and strategies that will allow us to be competitive from day one. The goal for this first season is to adapt to the pace of the competition, learn from every game, and continue growing as a team.

At Club Futsal Altafulla, we are not only aiming for success on the court; we also want to be part of the community. That's why we invite all futsal fans in Altafulla to follow us, support us at games, and, of course, join the club as players or collaborators.

If you are passionate about futsal and want to be part of a growing team, don’t hesitate to contact us! We are open to welcoming new talents and people who want to help Club Futsal Altafulla become a reference in futsal.

Club Futsal Altafulla is taking its first steps, but we are full of excitement and energy to face the challenges ahead. You’ll soon see us on the courts, and we hope to count on your support in this exciting adventure.

See you at the games!

## We look forward to seeing you at the next match

Thank you so much for supporting the team at every match. We will continue to give our all for you and take the team to the highest level.
