With the referee's final whistle, we have reached the end of a preseason filled with intensity, effort, and growth. Throughout these matches, we not only competed at the highest level but also reinforced something even more important: the team has solidified itself as a true family.

Although the results were not always what we hoped for, the team has successfully faced opponents from higher divisions, showing that with each game, our play improved. In every match, the players' commitment, dedication, and unity were evident, fighting until the end and consistently demonstrating progress.

The challenge of facing more experienced teams has been an opportunity to learn and raise our level of competitiveness. Now, the team is more prepared than ever to take the next step forward.

With the preseason concluded, we are already focused on what comes next: the start of the league. Training sessions have already begun, and with the same passion and dedication that has defined us, we are ready to face new challenges and continue growing as a team.

## We look forward to seeing you at the next match

Thank you so much for supporting the team at every match. We will continue to give our all for you and take the team to the highest level.
