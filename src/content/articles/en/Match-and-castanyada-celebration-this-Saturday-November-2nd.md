This Saturday, November 2nd, our futsal team will go head-to-head with Fundació Pef. La Pobla Mafumet A in an exciting home game. We're ready to give it our all on the court and build on the strong level of play we’ve been showcasing. It’s set to be a pivotal match, and we’re counting on all our supporters to cheer us on to victory.

But that's not all: after the match, we’ll be hosting a Castanyada (Chestnut Festival) at the pavilion, open to everyone who attends! We’re eager to celebrate this tradition with our community and enjoy a great time together with roasted chestnuts and a lively atmosphere.

Everyone is invited: fans, family, friends, and anyone who wants to join the celebration. It’s a wonderful chance to gather, share good times, and celebrate together—whatever the match outcome.

### Support and Fun for All Ages!

We encourage everyone to come out, enjoy the match, and stay to celebrate the Castanyada with us. This is about more than just football; it’s about community, tradition, and the pride of sharing special moments together!

See you this Saturday at the pavilion!
