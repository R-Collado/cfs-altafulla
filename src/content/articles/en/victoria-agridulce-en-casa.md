Our team secured an important 4-2 victory against a strong opponent in a match that thrilled the fans but also brought bitter news that overshadowed the celebration. Aleix, the team’s captain and undisputed leader, suffered a shoulder injury during the match, forcing the team to face the upcoming games without their iconic figure.

Despite this setback, the players delivered a solid performance, demonstrating greater chemistry and experience in the key moments of the match. Eloy shone with a brace, while Jose Hoyo and Hakim also scored, shaping a victory that strengthens the team’s confidence and their position in the league.

The team displayed remarkable composure in managing pressure, especially when the opponent attempted to narrow the scoreline with quick combinations and transitions in tight spaces. The defense, with impeccable work in coverage and blocks, successfully contained the offensive attempts. This organization allowed the attackers to take advantage of open spaces and create chances, converting them effectively.

Aleix’s injury, however, was an emotional blow for both the locker room and the fans. His leadership on and off the pitch will be hard to replace in the coming weeks, but the team made it clear that this victory was dedicated to him.

As usual, the fans provided unwavering support throughout the 40 minutes. Now, the team will face their upcoming challenges with the goal of maintaining their positive streak and dedicating more successes to their captain.
