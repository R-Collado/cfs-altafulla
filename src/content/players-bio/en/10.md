Aleix, our captain and the heart of this team, is a fundamental pillar both on and off the field.

Recognized for his technical skill and scoring ability, Aleix has been a central figure in futsal at every level since his childhood.

From his early days at the now-defunct Club Futbol Sala Altafulla, Aleix stood out in every youth category, becoming a key player on each team. He also had the honor of performing the ceremonial first kick at the inauguration of the teamâ€™s pavilion, an act that underscores his role as a respected leader. His career also includes stints with Club Vila-Seca Futbol Sala and Centre Esports Altafulla, where he demonstrated his versatility and commitment by competing in 11-a-side football.

As captain, Aleix tactfully leads from the front, inspiring his teammates to reach new heights and overcome challenges together in pursuit of victory. His leadership goes beyond goals and assists; it strengthens the team's spirit and cohesion. Aleix Roberto is not just the heart of the team, but a player whose influence and charisma are essential to the continued success of his teammates and supporters.
